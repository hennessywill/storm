# storm
Storm is a brainstorming web app I built as my final project in CS 598: Social Spaces on the Internet at the University of Illinois.

The goal of this computer-mediated communication tool is to create a brainstorming environment without peer pressure and reputation influencers.

Face-to-face brainstorming has some notable advantages, but I believe this CMC tool may be better for some teams.

I hope to test a few small groups with this tool and report interesting findings.
