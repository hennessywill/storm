# storm
Storm is a brainstorming web app I built as my final project in CS 598: Social Spaces on the Internet at the University of Illinois.

Face-to-face brainstorming is the norm, but it has some notable flaws. It allows groupthink to hinder creative thought, it lets personal reputation influence group opinions, and it exposes team members to personal criticism.

The goal of this computer-mediated communication tool is to eliminate these problems by designing a structured and anonymous brainstorm flow.

I hope to test this tool on a few small groups and report interesting findings.
